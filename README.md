# FoundryVTT Improviser Assistant

This module helps generate tokens and assets when improvising in a tabletop RPG session. It aims to provide a smooth and efficient workflow that's so fast, you can feasibly generate assets on the fly.

It is not intended to be a replacement for good preparation or ethically sourcing quality assets. It seeks not to replace existing tools and artists but to enable a new kind of ad-hoc visual storytelling that is quick and improvisationalâ€”one that augments the many great ways to run TTRPGs by adding one more.
